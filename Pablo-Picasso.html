          Pablo Ruiz Picasso was a Spanish painter, sculptor, printmaker,
          ceramicist and theatre designer who spent most of his adult life in
          France. Regarded as one of the most influential artists of the 20th
          century, he is known for co-founding the Cubist movement, the
          invention of constructed sculpture, the co-invention of collage, and
          for the wide variety of styles that he helped develop and explore.
